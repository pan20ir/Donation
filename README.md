# Donation Analytics challenge

Dear reviewers:

Please note that last section of the Python script is taking longer time to order data in required format. I also noticed that Github does not allow to import itcont.txt larger than 25 Mb even though it was mentioned 100 MB in guideline. So, I tried 100MB first and did not work, therefore, I reduced the file size to 23.7 MB by deleting more data.

Thank you,
Hamid
